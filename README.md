# timer-switch
 Turns an Arduino into a digital timer with switch. Most timers that can switch AC voltage are analog, with switching happening at a maximum of every 30 minutes. Many digital ones are like this as well. This code enables an Arduino to switch AC voltage at minimum intervals of 1 second. You might want this for example, if you had to run a pump for 15 seconds every five minutes.
